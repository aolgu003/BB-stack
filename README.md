# BB-stack
Code stack for my beagle bone. First attempt at setting up at setting up a cross compiling environment between my Linux desktop machine and an embedded Linux platform. In addition my intention with repo is experiment with different design patterns for embedded development. I will be trying to keep my code clean and follow a tdd flow.
